// READ AND WRITE USING PROMISES.
import fs from "node:fs/promises";

// STEP 1: Open file (read + write allowed)
const fileHandle = await fs.open("myText.txt", "r+");

// STEP 2: Create a read stream
const readStream = fileHandle.createReadStream();
readStream.setEncoding("utf-8");

// STEP 3: Listen for data events

// STEP 4: Handle end event

  // STEP: 5. Write only after reading finishes
